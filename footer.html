          This project addresses the challenge of traffic congestion in urban areas by developing an automated traffic light management system using a Raspberry Pi 4. The system employs YOLOv5-nano for real-time vehicle detection and dynamically adjusts traffic light timings based on toy car density across two lanes. The solution integrates a camera module, LED lights controlled via GPIO pins, and a Python-based software framework, offering an innovative approach to improve traffic flow in a controlled environment.
